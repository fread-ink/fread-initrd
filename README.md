These are some scripts and config files to make it easier to compile the fread initrd (initial ramdisk).

# Pre-built binary

There is a pre-built binary in the `bin/` directory.

# Compiling

Documentation is available in the readme file for [fread-vagrant](https://github.com/fread-ink/fread-vagrant) and I highly suggest you use that vagrant system rather than trying to install the dependencies directly.

# ToDo

* Rename initrd to initramfs since that's what we're actually using
